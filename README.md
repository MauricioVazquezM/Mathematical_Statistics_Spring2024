## Definition of Mathematical Statistics

Mathematical statistics is the application of probability theory, a branch of mathematics, to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data. Specific mathematical techniques which are used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure theory. Involves developing and studying methods for estimating population parameters, testing hypotheses, and making predictions based on sample data. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including:

- **Probability Theory:** The mathematical study of randomness and uncertainty. Probability theory provides the foundation for statistical inference, enabling statisticians to quantify the likelihood of various outcomes.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Techniques for summarizing and visualizing data, including measures of central tendency (like the mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (such as variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range).
- **Inferential Statistics:** Methods for drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample. This includes estimating population parameters, testing hypotheses, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
- **Bayesian Statistics:** A framework for statistical inference in which probabilities are interpreted as degrees of belief or confidence rather than frequencies. Bayesian statistics uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence becomes available.
- **Statistical Models and Decision Theory:** The construction and analysis of mathematical models that represent complex relationships within data. This includes linear models, generalized linear models, mixed models, and non-parametric models, as well as the study of decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Experimental Design:** The planning of experiments to ensure that the data collected can provide meaningful and valid conclusions. This involves selecting the type and number of subjects, determining the variables to be measured, and deciding on the structure of the experiment.

Mathematical statistics is used in various fields such as economics, engineering, social sciences, and biology, providing essential tools for research and decision-making. It combines theoretical mathematics with practical applications, allowing for the analysis and interpretation of real-world data.
