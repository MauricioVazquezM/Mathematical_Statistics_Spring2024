## Definition of Mathematical Statistics

Mathematical statistics is the application of probability theory, a branch of mathematics, to statistics, as opposed to techniques for collecting statistical data. Specific mathematical techniques which are used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure theory. Involves developing and studying methods for estimating population parameters, testing hypotheses, and making predictions based on sample data. It encompasses a wide range of topics, including:

- **Probability Theory**: The mathematical study of randomness and uncertainty. Probability theory provides the foundation for statistical inference, enabling statisticians to quantify the likelihood of various outcomes.
