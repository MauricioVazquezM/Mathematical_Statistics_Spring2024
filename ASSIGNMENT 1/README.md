## Stirling approximation

- The Stirling approximation is a formula used to estimate the factorial of a large number, n!. It is especially useful in probability theory, statistics, and various areas of physics and engineering where calculations involve the factorials of large numbers.

  **The Stirling approximation**
```math
\[ n! \approx \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left( \frac{n}{e} \right)^n \]

where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $n!$ is the factorial of $n$,
    \item $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to 2.71828,
    \item $\pi$ is the constant pi, approximately equal to 3.14159.
\end{itemize}
